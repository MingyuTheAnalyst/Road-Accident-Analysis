### Project Overview
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of road accident data over two years, 2021 and 2022, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive dashboard. This tool is designed to offer insights into accident trends, severity, and impacts, assisting in data-driven decision-making.
### Data Sources

Road Accident Data: The primary dataset for this analysis, covering detailed records of road accidents for the specified years.

### Tools

- Power Query - Data Cleaning
- Power BI - Data Exploration, Creating Dashboard
- Powerpoint - Design Dashboard

### Requirement
Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements:
- Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
- Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
- Casualties by Road Type for Current Year
- Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location


### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Correct the wrong values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Create Data modelling
